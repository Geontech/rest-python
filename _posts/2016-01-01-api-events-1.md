These structures are exclusively defined as one would find on the ODM and IDM channels in a REDHAWK system since those structures are simply converted into dictionaries and lists, as appropriate, but using JSON for syntax.

> **NOTE:** The provided enumeration value for the affected fields was arbitrarily chosen as the index within the defining list so that the structure provided here is similar to [Properties](/api/properties.html).

**ODM Events**

{
    "producerId":       "DCE:9ae444e0-0bfd-4e3d-b16c-1cffb3dc0f46",
    "sourceId":         "DCE:820e3275-4462-4823-b754-e09b4712869e", 

    "sourceName":       "FEIDevice_1", 
    "sourceCategory":   { 
        /* See enumerations */ 
        "value":        "DEVICE"
        "enumerations": {
            "DEVICE_MANAGER"        : 0, 
            "DEVICE"                : 1,
            "APPLICATION_FACTORY"   : 2,
            "APPLICATION"           : 3,
            "SERVICE"               : 4
        }
    },
    "sourceIOR":        "" /* OPTIONAL */
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `sourceIOR` and other object reference types are stripped since they're of little use on the other side of the socket.  Instead you will see the key name, like `sourceIOR`, but the value will be a string indicating it does not represent what the real value was in any way.  **NOTE:** The _presence_ of the `sourceIOR` key indicates the entity was added to the Domain.

**IDM Events**
