At present the best way to get Messages and property change events out of rest-python is to attach the associated port (in REDHAWK) to a named event channel.  Then subscribe to that channel name as your topic to read those messages and property events as they happen.

**Messages**
{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "id":     "propertyId",
    "value":  [ 
        /* List of id-value pairs */
        { "id": "propertyId::field1", "value": 42 }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Messages are encapsulated as they appear on the event channel which is similar to `struct` [Properties](/api/properties.html).  The notable difference is the lack metadata (`type`, `scaType`, etc.).

**propEvent**
{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "sourceId":     "entityId",
    "sourceName":   "entityName",
    "properties": [
        /* List of Message-like objects */
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `properties` is a list of objects formatted like Messages, above, meaning each lacks any metadata usually associated with [Properties](/api/properties.html).
