These structures are exclusively defined as one would find on the ODM and IDM channels in a REDHAWK system since those structures are simply converted into dictionaries and lists, as appropriate, but using JSON for syntax.

**ODM Events**
{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "producerId":       "DCE:9ae444e0-0bfd-4e3d-b16c-1cffb3dc0f46",
    "sourceId":         "DCE:820e3275-4462-4823-b754-e09b4712869e", 
    "sourceName":       "FEIDevice_1", 
    "sourceCategory":   { 
        /* See enumerations */ 
        "value":        "DEVICE"
        "enumerations": [
            "DEVICE_MANAGER", 
            "DEVICE",
            "APPLICATION_FACTORY",
            "APPLICATION",
            "SERVICE"
        ]
    },
    "sourceIOR":        "" /* OPTIONAL */
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `sourceIOR` and other object reference types are stripped since they're of little use on the other side of the socket.  Instead you will see the key name, like `sourceIOR`, but the value will be a string indicating it does not represent what the real value was in any way.  **NOTE:** The _presence_ of the `sourceIOR` key indicates the entity was added to the Domain.

**IDM Events**

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "producerId":       "DCE:9ae444e0-0bfd-4e3d-b16c-1cffb3dc0f46",

    "stateChangeCategory": {
        /* See enumerations */
        "value":        "ADMINISTRATIVE_STATE_EVENT",
        "enumerations": [
            "ADMINISTRATIVE_STATE_EVENT",
            "OPERATIONAL_STATE_EVENT",
            "USAGE_STATE_EVENT"
        ]
    },
    "stateChangeFrom": {
        /* See enumerations */
        "value":        "LOCKED",
        "enumerations": [
            "LOCKED",
            "UNLOCKED",
            "SHUTTING_DOWN",
            "ENABLED",
            "DISABLED",
            "IDLE",
            "ACTIVE",
            "BUSY"
        ]
    },
    "stateChangeTo" : {
        /* Identical behavior to stateChangeFrom */
    }
}
