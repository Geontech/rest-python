#### Required Properties:
 * `idl.namespace   == "BULKIO"`
 * `idl.type        == any("dataFloat", "dataDouble", "dataOctet", "dataShort")`
 * `direction       == "Uses"`

This socket provides both JSON and binary data.  The JSON data is a representation of the SRI:

{% include sri.md %}

The binary data is a vector of the appropriate type of information.

> **NOTE:** Those familiar with REDHAWK can see there is no stream ID to marry the SRI with the binary stream.  At this time multiple streams on a socket will be interleaved in such a way that re-joining the SRI with the data may be impossible.  This will be resolved in a future release when this interface transmits only binary as a Google Protobuf structure.
