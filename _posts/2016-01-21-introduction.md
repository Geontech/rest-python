Welcome to the long-overdue API documentation for [Geon's](http://www.geontech.com) modified version of [rest-python](http://github.com/geontech/rest-python)!  It's a _distant_ fork of the excellent version backing the [admin-console](http://github.com/redhawksdr/admin-console) UI released last year, adding several features we've found useful including Frontend Interfaces and event channels.

Subscribe to the posts feed or the repository to keep informed of changes to the API.  Shortly, we will also be posting a user's guide for our Angular.JS -based UI framework that is also loosely-based on an early version of admin-console.
