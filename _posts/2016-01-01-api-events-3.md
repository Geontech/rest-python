That would be **really** awesome.  Thank you for volunteering to add that feature. :-)

At this time we do not have a way to inject Messages back into an event channel.  If you would like to write the handlers for this, please do so and submit a pull request.  Otherwise, just know it's on our _To Do_ list.
