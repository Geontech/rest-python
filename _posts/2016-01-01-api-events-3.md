At present the best way to get Messages and property change events out of rest-python is to attach the associated port (in REDHAWK) to a named event channel.  Then subscribe to that channel name as your topic to read those messages and property events as they happen.

Messages and propEvent ports convey their information as property ID-value streams:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "id":     "propertyId",
    "value":  [ /* List of id-value pairs */ ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Unlike [Properties](/api/properties.html), no property _type_ information is included in the structure at this time, however care has been taken to ensure these structures are similar to the originating property (on the Device, Component, etc.) for messages, and the property changed event type, as defined in REDHAWK SDR.  

**NOTE:** At this time we do not have a way to inject messages back into an event channel.  If you would like to write the handlers for this, please do so and submit a pull request.  Otherwise, just know it's on our _To Do_ list. :-)
