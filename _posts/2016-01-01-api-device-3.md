{% include JB/setup %}
{% highlight javascript %}
{
    /* configure, allocate, deallocate */
    "method": "configure",
    "properties": [
        /* simplified list of properties */
        {
            "id":       "propertyId",
            "value":    ""  /* As appropriate */   
        },
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `properties` field is a list of structures which follow the structures defined in [Properties](/api/properties.html) with the exception that only the `id` and `value` fields are important.  Everything else is optional and _will be ignored at the server_.

In all cases, the server will respond with this structure:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "method":   "configure",
    "status":   true,
    "message":  ""  
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `method` will always match what was attempted.  It is **not** possible to perform two methods at the same time.

The `status` field will be the response of the Device attempting to `allocate` or `deallocate` the properties.  The `configure` method returns `void`, so its return status is `true` to assume success (unless an Exception is thrown, at which point `message` will indicate).

The `message` is any number of responses of the Device to the `method` for the provided property list.
