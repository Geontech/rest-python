{"name":"rest-python","tagline":"The Generic REST API for REDHAWK SDR","body":"### REDHAWK REST API\r\n\r\nThis project is a fork of [the REDHAWK SDR](https://github.com/redhawksdr/rest-python) implementation with several tweaks and extensions added to support UI development.  However like that project, ours has also lacked any detailed documentation for the API the server provides.  So in addition to our [Wiki pages](https://github.com/Geontech/rest-python/wiki), please use this site as your guide to developing web-based (or otherwise) apps.\r\n\r\n### General Concepts\r\n\r\nAt its core, this server taps into the REDHAWK SDR python sandbox.  Many of the activities you can do in that environment also apply to this server, but are wrapped with two different sets of interfaces.  \r\n\r\nThe first are HTTP requests including GET, POST, etc. These are typically for getting and setting static elements from the REDHAWK system like Component names or properties.  \r\n\r\nThe second interface is through web sockets.  These are exclusively for asynchronous interactions such as event channel or BULKIO transfers.  At this time, these transfers are unidirectional from the server up to your client.\r\n\r\n### Digging In\r\n\r\nThe following links can be used to dig into the the what interests you.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-50975337-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
